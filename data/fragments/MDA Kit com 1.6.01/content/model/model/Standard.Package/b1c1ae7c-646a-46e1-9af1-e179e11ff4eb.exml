            <ATT name="Content"><![CDATA[<p>There are two types of relationships between these layers:</p><p>1. <em>Serving</em> relationships, between technology service and the different types of application&nbsp;behavior elements, and between technology interface and application component; vice&nbsp;versa, serving relationships between application service and technology behavior, and&nbsp;application interface and node. These relationships represent the behavioral and structural&nbsp;aspects of the use of technology infrastructure by applications and vice versa.</p><p>2. <em>Realization</em> relationships from technology process or function to application process or&nbsp;function, from technology object to data object, to indicate that the data object is realized&nbsp;by, for example, a physical data file, from technology object to application component, to&nbsp;indicate that a physical data file is an executable that realizes an application or part of an&nbsp;application. (Note: In this case, an artifact represents a &quot;physical&quot; component that is&nbsp;deployed on a node; this is modeled with an assignment relationship. A (logical)&nbsp;application component is realized by an artifact and, indirectly, by the node on which the&nbsp;artifact is deployed.)</p>
