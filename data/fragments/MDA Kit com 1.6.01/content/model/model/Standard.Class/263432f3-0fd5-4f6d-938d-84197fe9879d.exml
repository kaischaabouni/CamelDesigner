            <ATT name="Content"><![CDATA[<p>A value stream describes how an enterprise organizes its activities to create value. As described&nbsp;in the TOGAF &reg; Series Guide: Value Streams, a key principle of value streams is that value is&nbsp;always defined from the perspective of the stakeholder &ndash; the customer, end user, or recipient of&nbsp;the product, service, or deliverable produced by the work. The value obtained is in the eye of the&nbsp;beholder; it depends more on the stakeholder&rsquo;s perception of the worth of the product, service,&nbsp;outcome, or deliverable than on its intrinsic value; i.e., the cost to produce. This is modeled in the&nbsp;ArchiMate language using the value element. This, in turn, is associated with on the one hand the&nbsp;result being produced, and on the other hand may be associated with the stakeholder.</p><p>Value streams can be defined at different levels of the organization; e.g., at the enterprise level,&nbsp;business unit level, or department level. Value streams can be a composition or aggregation of&nbsp;sub-streams, usually called value (stream) stages, where each stage should have a clear value&nbsp;contribution of its own. These stages are typically related using flow relationships to model the&nbsp;flow of value between them. Resources can be assigned to value streams and capabilities can serve&nbsp;(i.e., enable) a value stream.</p><p>Importantly, value streams and business processes may seem alike, but they are defined at different&nbsp;abstraction levels and serve separate purposes. A business process describes the (time-ordered)&nbsp;sequence of behaviors required to create some result for an individual case, and it may describe&nbsp;alternative paths and decision points (modeled with junctions). In contrast, a value stream focuses<br />
on the overall value-creating behavior from the perspective of the importance, worth, or usefulness&nbsp;of what is produced, and is not a description of time-ordered tasks for individual cases. Value&nbsp;streams (and capabilities) reflect an organization&rsquo;s business model and value proposition, whereas&nbsp;business processes (and business functions) reflect its operating model. At their respective&nbsp;abstraction levels, value streams and business processes both represent the &lsquo;enterprise in motion&rsquo;,&nbsp;whereas capabilities and business functions both describe the &lsquo;enterprise at rest&rsquo;.</p><p>Value streams are typically realized by business processes and possibly other core behavior&nbsp;elements. The stages in a value stream provide a framework for organizing and defining business&nbsp;processes, but different parts of the organization may have their own implementations of business&nbsp;processes that realize the same value stream stage. Conversely, one business process may realize<br />
multiple stages in a value stream.</p>
