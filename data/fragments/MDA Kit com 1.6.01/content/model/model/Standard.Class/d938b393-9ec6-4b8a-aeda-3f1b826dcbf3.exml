            <ATT name="Content"><![CDATA[<p>A business process describes the internal behavior performed by a business role that is required&nbsp;to produce a set of products and services. For a consumer, the products and services are relevant&nbsp;and the required behavior is merely a black box, hence the designation &quot;internal&quot;.</p><p>A complex business process may be an aggregation of other, finer-grained processes, each of&nbsp;which may be assigned to finer-grained roles that are aggregated by roles that are aggregated by&nbsp;the original role.</p><p>There is a potential many-to-many relationship between business processes and business&nbsp;functions. Informally speaking, processes describe some kind of &quot;flow&quot; of activities, whereas&nbsp;functions group activities according to required skills, knowledge, resources, etc.</p><p>A business process may be triggered by, or trigger, any other business behavior element (e.g.,&nbsp;business event, business process, business function, or business interaction). A business process&nbsp;may access business objects. A business process may realize one or more business services and&nbsp;may use (internal) business services or application services. A business role or an application&nbsp;component may be assigned to a business process to perform this process manually or&nbsp;automated, respectively. The name of a business process should clearly indicate a predefined&nbsp;sequence of actions, and may include the word &quot;process&quot;. Examples are &quot;adjudicate claim&quot;,&nbsp;&quot;employee on-boarding&quot;, &quot;approval process&quot;, or &quot;financial reporting&quot;.</p><p>In an ArchiMate model, the existence of business processes is depicted. High-level business,&nbsp;end-to-end processes, macro flows, and workflows can all be expressed with the same business&nbsp;process element in the ArchiMate language. It does not, however, list the flow of activities in</p><p>detail. This is typically done during business process modeling, where a business process can be&nbsp;expanded using a business process design language; e.g., BPMN</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
