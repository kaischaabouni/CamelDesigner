            <ATT name="Content"><![CDATA[<p>In the field of business, strategic thinking and planning delivers strategies and high-level goals&nbsp;that are often not directly implementable in the architecture of an organization. These long-term&nbsp;or generic plans need to be specified and made actionable in a way that both business leaders&nbsp;and Enterprise Architects can relate to and at a relatively high abstraction level.</p><p>Capabilities help to reduce this gap by focusing on business outcomes. On the one hand, they&nbsp;provide a high-level view of the current and desired abilities of an organization, in relation to its&nbsp;strategy and its environment. On the other hand, they are realized by various elements (people,&nbsp;processes, systems, and so on) that can be described, designed, and implemented using&nbsp;Enterprise Architecture approaches. Capabilities may also have influence relationships; for&nbsp;example, to denote that one capability contributes to another.</p><p>Capabilities are expressed in general and high-level terms and are typically realized by a&nbsp;combination of organization, people, processes, information, and technology. For example,&nbsp;marketing, customer contact, or outbound telemarketing [4].</p><p>Capabilities are typically aimed at achieving some goal or delivering value by realizing an&nbsp;outcome. Capabilities are themselves realized by core elements. To denote that a set of core&nbsp;elements together realizes a capability, grouping can be used.</p><p>Capabilities are often used for capability-based planning, to describe their evolution over time.</p><p>To model such so-called capability increments, the specialization relationship can be used to&nbsp;denote that a certain capability increment is a specific version of that capability. Aggregating&nbsp;those increments and the core elements that realize them in plateaus (see Section 13.2.4) can be&nbsp;used to model the evolution of the capabilities.</p>
