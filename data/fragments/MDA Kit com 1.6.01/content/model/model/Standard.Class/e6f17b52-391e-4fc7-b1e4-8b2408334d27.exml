            <ATT name="Content"><![CDATA[<p>The assignment relationship links active structure elements with units of behavior that are&nbsp;performed by them, business actors with business roles that are fulfilled by them, locations with&nbsp;structure elements, and artifacts with nodes. It can, for example, relate an internal active&nbsp;structure element with an internal behavior element, an interface with a service, or a location&nbsp;with an active or passive structure element. The full set of permitted relationships is listed in&nbsp;Appendix B.</p><p>Note that although this notation is not directional, the assignment relationship does have a&nbsp;direction at the metamodel level. In the ArchiMate framework described in Section 3.4, it always&nbsp;points from a location to an active structure element, from active structure to behavior, and from&nbsp;active structure to passive structure. This directionality may optionally be expressed in the&nbsp;notation by omitting the black dot at the source end of the relationship, only showing it at the&nbsp;destination end.</p><p>As with all structural relationships, an assignment relationship can also be expressed by nesting&nbsp;the model elements. The direction mentioned above is also the direction of nesting; for example,&nbsp;a business actor can be drawn inside the location where it resides, a business role inside the&nbsp;business actor performing that role, an application function inside an application component&nbsp;executing that function, or an artifact inside a node that stores it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The usual interpretation of an assignment relationship is that whole or part of the source element&nbsp;is assigned the whole of the target element. This means that if, for example, two active structure&nbsp;elements are assigned to the same behavior element, either of them can perform the complete&nbsp;behavior. If both active structure elements are needed to perform the behavior, the grouping&nbsp;element or a junction (see Section 5.4.3) can be used, and if the combination of these elements&nbsp;has a more substantive and independent character, a collaboration would be the right way to&nbsp;express this.</p>
